The City of Yokyo had won the bid to host the next FunOlympic Games in 2019/20 but this had to be postponed due to a worldwide pandemic.  During the build-up to the planned games in 2019/20 the city had already invested hugely in IT infrastructure and systems to make sure that the games would have been well organized, staffed, attended, and accessible to everyone.

Due to the pandemic restrictions, the FunOlympic committee have decided to run the 2020/21 games without the public attending the site. So now they have a number of additional projects which need to be completed before the delayed games start to ensure athletes remain healthy while attending the games and also that worldwide audiences can enjoy the games online.

The city have appointed a team of IT systems and infrastructure professionals – you are one of them. It is your job to interact with the client to clarify exact system requirements.

You will gain more information needed to complete the design and development task via client meetings and these meetings will reflect the knowledge and skill set appropriate to your programme of study.  You will not be required to provide the entire solution – see details below:

The committee require you to build an online registration system for audiences to gain access to the proposed broadcast platform. The system must allow users to register, login and logout when using it, and make selections of broadcasts they wish to watch. There should also be an admin side to the system to allow an admin user to view user interactions, reset passwords etc. The prototype solution must deliver the key functionality described (you will need to interview the client to derive a full requirements list), although at this prototypical stage the inclusion of mechanisms for securing payments is not required.
